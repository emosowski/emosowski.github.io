    <h2>CSS Positioning Schemes</h2>
    <h4>February 6, 2016</h4>

      <section>
      <p>
          CSS has three positioning schemes, Static, Relative and Absolute, that allow you to control the layout of a page. Using the position property, you can specify which scheme you would like to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
          <h4><p>position: static;</p></h4>

          STATIC POSITIONING is the default behavior of each element. Each element appears on a new line down the page, regardless of if there is space side by side for two elements.
      </p>
      <p>
          <h4><p>position: relative;</p></h4>

          RELATIVE POSITIONING moves the element from where it would be in static positioning to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been. You can indicate how far to move the element (from where it would have been in static positioning) using the top, bottom, left, or right properties. Relative positioning does not affect the positioning of the elements around it.
      </p>
      <p>
         <h4><p>position: absolute;</p></h4>

          ABSOLUTE POSITIONING takes the element out of normal flow and it does not affect the position of the other elements on the page. The other elements act like the absolute element does not exist. You can use top, bottom, left or right properties to determine where the element should appear in relation to its container.

          <h4><p>position: fixed;</p></h4>

          FIXED POSITIONING is a type of absolute positioning that places the element in relation to the browser window. When you scroll down the page, a fixed position element stays visible in the exact same place.
      </p>

  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  Wireframing and creating an HTML page with my pair was interesting, and helped me further understand the benefits of wireframing prior to coding.

  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

  I did find wireframing to be helpful to the devlopment process as it made translating the elements into html much more intuitive with the visual representation to go off of.

  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

  I think we both decided that a simple structure with clear details made a good wireframe.

  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

  I learned a couple new semantic elements, as my pair was more experienced with HTML.
