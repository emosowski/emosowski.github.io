    <h1>My First Blog</h1>
    <h2>Version control, git, and Github!</h2>
    <h4>January 23, 2016</h4>

          This week I learned about version control, a version control program, git, and, a website, Github. Version control is enormously helpful in keeping track of changes as you work on various project both solo, and, collaboratively.

      </p>
      <p>
          Git is a version control program that  allows for you to create save points or “commits" within your work that you can label and later return to, either for reference, or to begin again. This can be essential when collaborating with a team on a project as it gives your teammates the opportunity to review your changes prior to adding them to the master copy. It helps your team work simultaneously, while safeguarding against mistakes, and,  prevents you from stepping on other people’s toes.
      </p>
      <p>
          Github is a website that serves as a hub for git repositories, making things even easier.  It streamlines your work further by showing you who changed what, when, and then allowing you to merge the changes, all within an easy to use graphical user interface. It saves time when collaborating because instead of sending the file back and forth, everything can be reviewed and merged on Github.
