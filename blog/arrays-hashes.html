    <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
    <h4>February 14, 2016</h4>

      <section>
      <p>
          <h3>Array:</h3>
          An array is a list in your computer and every slot in the lists acts like a variable. You can see what object each slot points to, and you can also make it point to a different object.

          <h3>Hash:</h3>
          A hash is a collection of pairs of information. Each pair consists of a key and a value. A key must be unique, while a value can be repeated within the same hash.

      </p>
      <p>
          <h3>So how do they differ?</h3>In an array the slots are in a row and you access each slot with an index number. Array index numbers start with 0. In a hash the slots are not in a row, and you access each slot with the key which point to the value.

          For example:
          <pre>
            <code>
              vegetables ["kale, "turnip", "collard greens", "carrot"]

              vegetables {
                            "kale" => "1 bunch"
                            "turnip" => "6"
                            "collard greens" => "1 bunch"
                            "carrot" => "1 lb"
                          }
            </code>
          </pre>

      </p>
      <p>
          The array is just a list, while the hash has pairs of information. Also note that I was able to use the same value twice within the hash, but all of the keys need to be unique. If a key is used more than once, it would return the most recent value for that key.

          To access a slot within an array I would need to use the array index number. Let's say I wanted to access "turnip". (I will use => to denote the return.)
          <pre>
            <code>
              vegetables[1]
              => "turnip"
            </code>
          </pre>

          To access a value within a hash I will need to call it using the key.
            <pre>
              <code>
                vegetables["kale"]
                => "1 bunch"
              </code>
            </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I want a grocery list that just tells me the item names, an array works. If I would like to also know how much of each item to get, a hash would be best. If you just have a list an array will do. Otherwise, hashes are great when you have a bunch of things to keep track of, but they don't fit well into an ordered list.
