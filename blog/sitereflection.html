          I have to say that when we were first tasked with building our own sites based on only a brief introduction to HTML and CSS, I was a bit concerned. We were warned that things would look rather archaic in this first attempt. I prepared for the worst, but I was rather surprised by how simple I found it to make a nice modern looking site.

          My favorite part of this experience was seeing the design come to life using CSS. While I enjoyed when everything came together, I would also say that CSS positioning was the most challenging portion of this. It seems that no matter how much experience you have, positioning tends to be a process of trial and error.

          Aside from the basics of HTML and CSS, creating my site helped me realize how important flexibility and resiliency is in developing. Things don't always go as you expect, even with a high level of planning and you need to be willing to keep at it until your goals are met. Also keep in mind that this end product may be better than what you originally intended, even though it is totally different than your initial plan.
