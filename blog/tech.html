          As we get a firmer grasp on the fundamentals of Ruby, it's only natural to ask the question: "What the heck is Rails?"

      </p>
      <p>
          <h3> Rails Quick Facts</h3>

<ul>
<li>An extremely productive web-application framework.</li>
<li>Written in Ruby by David Heinemeier Hansson.</li>
<li>You could develop a web application at least ten times faster with Rails than you could with a typical Java framework.</li>
<li>An open source Ruby framework for developing database-backed web applications.</li>
<li>Configure your code with Database Schema.</li>
<li>No compilation phase required.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
          <h3>Full Stack Framework</h3>

Rails is not a programming langauge. Rather, it is a full stack framework, which means all of the layers work perfectly together with less code. It includes everything needed to create a database-driven web application, using the Model-View-Controller pattern.

Model-View-Controller pattern consists of Ruby classes (Models) that deal with logic, Templates (Views) that take info from the models and show it to the user, and the Controller which exists between the models and views to handle requests.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Why Use Rails?</h3>

Rails has many features that make you more productive. A few of these include:

<h4>Metaprogramming:</h4> Instead of relying on generating code from scratch, Rail framework uses Metaprogramming. "Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs with the ability to treat programs as their data. It means that a program could be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running."

<h4>Active Record:</h4> Rails uses Active Record to save objects into the database.

<h4>Conventions:</h4> If you follow suggested naming conventions, Rails doesn't need much configuration.
</p>
<p>
  The bottom line is: Rails is a framework written in Ruby that will make your life as a programmer easier. Sounds pretty good to me.
